# Embedded-Systems-IR-Alarm-Clock

Overall the project was meant to use the functionality of all the components that were provided
  to us including an LCD, LED array, temperature sensor, IR sensor, IR remote, hex keypad, and piezo buzzer.

The final result was an alarm clock that read temperatures and displayed it to the LCD. The alarm was
  set using a remote control and additional modes like farenheit to celsius was capable through the remote.

main: Main function that handles the overall interface
  which involves setting an alarm on a clock that also
  is able to tell the current temperature
